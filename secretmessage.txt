Hello to whomever gets this note.
I just wanted to say thank you for all the hard work you guys do and for always being attentive and patient with us. I know it's not easy to spend your summertime working and teaching others but we do appreciate it and honestly without you guys I don't think we would have been able to really understand the material and be able to do our projects. The lab sessions are invaluable and they are where I feel like we learn the most since we get to implement and test out what we learned in our zybooks and in class. And with you guys' help we are able to honestly quickly learn this material that a year ago seemed like complete magic to me. So really thank you so much for all the hard work, effort and patience that you guys have shown us this summer session and I hope to have you guys as my TA's in another class and I wish you good luck with your studies and future endavours.
